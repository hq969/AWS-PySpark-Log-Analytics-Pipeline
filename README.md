# Real-Time-Log-Analytics-with-PySpark-and-AWS
This project implements a real-time log analytics pipeline using AWS and Apache Spark (PySpark) to process, analyze, and visualize streaming server logs. It simulates web traffic, processes logs on-the-fly, and generates insightful analytics to detect performance bottlenecks, error patterns, and usage trends.
